# Cookbook Application
This is a showcase application for me to practice different aspects of development,
not least of which; architecture. This application will follow a couple of different
paths. First, the application will be written in the naive implementation. Once that
phase is functional, each aspect will either be elaborated upon, or implemented in
plain Java. In this way, I hope to better understand the rationale for different 
architecture patterns, and the underlying mechanisms of the tools we use every day.

### Application Description
The primary function of the application will be to publish recipes, and share them
within a network of other users. Primary features (and the topics which I can expect
 to learn) will include:
* Single Page Application (Vue all-around)
* Unique Logins (Security from front-end to the DB)
* Publish and Save Recipes (Database structure)
* Following Users (Social Networking)
* Chronological News Feed (Data Synthesis)
* Rating System (Message Queue)
* Cloud Hosted (AWS and GCP)
* REST API (REST vs. SOAP API structure)

This is only an initial list of features.

### Initial Tech Stack:
* Vue 3
* Gradle
* Spring MVC
* MySQL
* AWS

### Future Additions:
* Plain Java Implementations
* NoSQL Adaptations?
* Microservices Architecture
* Docker
* Jenkins
* GCP

### Current Tasks
* Create a text post system
